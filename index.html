    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="blurb">
        I'm Matt Thompson, a Computer Science major at Rochester Institute of Technology by day and a Discord bot developer by night. I started getting into code around 2014, before my work on Porygon2 thrust it into my field of interest. I'm currently looking for a co-op position for the summer of 2020.
        
        <br><br>
        Some fun facts:
        <ul>
            <li>I'm minoring in Spanish, and would consider myself pretty fluent.</li>
            <li>I'm a Discord Partner (yes, the hoodie is nice) and have helped to run two large-scale servers.</li>
            <li>I love to explore: I've driven across the United States and have gone on a 26-day backpacking trip in the Sierra Nevadas.</li>
        </ul>

            Porygon2 is a multi-function Discord bot written from scratch over the course of 5 years (2015-present). It was created originally to serve a small gaming community (/r/MysteryDungeon). Its primary server shifted to /r/Pokemon, where it remained the primary bot for 4 years, at one point serving a community of 100,000 users. It serves moderation and managerial purposes, as well as memes. <br><a href="http://github.com/chafla/Pory2">github</a>

            Allows a Turtlebot to autonomously explore its surroundings in simulations,

            HockeyBot is a small bot that I wrote during the fall of 2016 for a friend in a hockey-related server. It accesses an open endpoint for NHL scores, parses the data, and feeds back scores as they happen to a chatroom. <br>

            goPC, also known as Somebody's PC, is a bot that I wrote soon after the release of the infamous mobile app Pok√©mon GO. I had previously written a small moderation-related bot for one of the largest discord servers related to the topic (currently at 20,000 members) with the purpose of allowing users to assign their own roles. As the popularity of the game grew, more and more people began to ask me for a version of the bot for their own servers, which I wrote up and released. It is currently in use in 85 different servers. <br>
