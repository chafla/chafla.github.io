            Porygon2 is a multi-function Discord bot written from scratch over the course of 5 years (2015-present). It was created originally to serve a small gaming community (/r/MysteryDungeon). Its primary server shifted to /r/Pokemon, where it remained the primary bot for 4 years, at one point serving a community of 100,000 users. It serves moderation and managerial purposes, as well as memes. <br><a href="http://github.com/chafla/Pory2">github</a>

            HockeyBot is a small bot that I wrote during the fall of 2016 for a friend in a hockey-related server. It accesses an open endpoint for NHL scores, parses the data, and feeds back scores as they happen to a chatroom. <br>

            goPC, also known as Somebody's PC, is a bot that I wrote soon after the release of the infamous mobile app Pok√©mon GO. I had previously written a small moderation-related bot for one of the largest discord servers related to the topic (currently at 20,000 members) with the purpose of allowing users to assign their own roles. As the popularity of the game grew, more and more people began to ask me for a version of the bot for their own servers, which I wrote up and released. It is currently in use in 85 different servers. <br>
