        This was a school project of mine, for my Applied Science, Engineering and Entrepeneurip class in my senior year of high school. Over the course of two semesters, I developed a software platform that can navigate a robot autonomously to explore an unknown environment.<br><br>
        
        This project is particularly special for me as it brought together many different facets of my high school programming experience into one overall project. On the robotics side, the robot platform was ROS (Robot Operating System), which I had learned how to use in my Senior year as Lead Programmer for our FIRST Robotics team. On the computer science side, the project involved optimized image processing using OpenCV, a skill that I had developed by creating memey image manipulation commands for <a href="porygon2.html">Porygon2</a>. I was also taking a high school course on Algorithms at the time, which gave me an in-depth understanding of pathfinding algorithms such as A*, necessary for navigation as well as wall-avoidance.
        
        <br><br>
        
        Huge shoutouts on this project go to my programming mentor Paul Ambrose for introducing me to ROS in the first place, and helping me out significantly over the course of this project.
