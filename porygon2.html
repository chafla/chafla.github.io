        As far as my programming experience has gone, Porygon2 has been my greatest labor of love.<br>
        Starting in 2015, I had a little bit of experience with CodeAcademy and rudimentary knowledge of APIs, though objects were still out of my grasp.
        Once Discord started to become popular, I felt that it would be fun to see if I could write a bot. Following some of the early tutorials that existed online at that point (and a <i>lot</i> of trial and error), I had developed a bot which I figured I'd call Porygon.<br>
        At this point in time, Porygon had about three or four commands, though over time I began to experiment with what I was capable of. I soon added a dice rolling command, some image-based memes, the usual. Once some folks from /r/Pokemon noticed and thought it was interesting, I brought the bot over there as well. With a larger audience, I began to dig even deeper, and Pory's real life began.<br>
        Over the years, it's gone through several full rewrites, all of which have resulted in cleaner, more concise code. For most of its life, the code has been entirely closed-source, though as of recently I've opened up a public mirror of the active dev repository.
